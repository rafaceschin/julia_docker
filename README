My attempt at creating a Jupyter Lab environment for Julia

Build the container:

docker build -t julia_lab 
(or any other name for the container)

Initialize the notebook with: 
docker run -it --user=$UID:$UID -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/data <container_name>

Where $(pwd) is whatever folder/workspace you want to access data/code in. The
notebook only has access to this folder (and anything within). 

I wrap it as a bashrc function: 
function JULAB { docker run -it --user=$UID:$UID -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/data <container_name>; }

The notebook sets the mounted folder as its home directory, and all Julia
compiled packages go there. So I like to have a main "Julia_WS" workspace
folder where all my Julia scripts go to reduce redundancy and storage space
for compiled packages.
